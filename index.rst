# Different types of e-cigarettes #

The first article I've written in a while is about the different types of e-cigarettes.

After using various types of e-cigarettes, I am now thinking about the fuel? I've been using various types of e-cigarettes and now I'd like to think about the type of fuel?

Currently, there seem to be two types of e-cigarettes: liquid type and cartridge type.

I've heard that Philip Morris has added a new heated type, but for now, I'd like to talk about the two types above.

Liquid type is a type that is used by refilling the body with liquid. As I wrote in a previous article, it is possible to make one's own liquid, so skilled users tend to use this type. I use both the cartridge type and the liquid type, and people around me often use this type.

The cartridge type can be used by plugging in a cartridge or directly sucking it, so refilling is rather easy compared to the liquid type.

I personally prefer this type because of the use-it-all and replaceable types I wrote about in my previous article.

However, it seems that the mainstream of e-cigarettes today is the liquid type, and the number of cartridge-type e-cigarettes is decreasing rapidly.

My colleague used to use the cartridge type, but switched to the liquid type because of the discontinuation of the cartridge type.

I have no particular problem because I use an import agent from [China vape factory](https://ecigator.com/) to buy them, but it seems to be difficult to buy them in Japan.

I'd like to try various types of e-cigarettes now that the new heated type e-cigarettes have appeared.
